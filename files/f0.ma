Maurer: level 0, k=15
  step 1.1, n = 21035
    n is composite by trial division (mod 5 = 0)
  step 1.1, n = 19371
    n is composite by trial division (mod 3 = 0)
  step 1.1, n = 28595
    n is composite by trial division (mod 5 = 0)
  step 1.1, n = 24167
    n is composite by trial division (mod 11 = 0)
