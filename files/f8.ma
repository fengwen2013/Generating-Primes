Maurer: level 0, k=39
  step 4, r = 50%
Maurer: level 1, k=20
  step 1.1, n = 666571
    n is composite by trial division (mod 239 = 0)
  step 1.1, n = 700339
    n passes trial division test
Maurer: back to level 0, k=39, q=700339
  step 7, itr 1: R = 355070, n = 497338737461
    n passes trial division test
  step 7.2.1, itr 1: a = 353580898131

Maurer's Algorithm found an 39-bit prime:
  n = 497338737461
